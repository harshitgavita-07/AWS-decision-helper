# AWS Decision Helper

A tiny web tool that helps developers choose between AWS Lambda and Amazon EC2 based on simple questions about traffic, operations, and cost.

## Problem

Many developers are unsure when to pick Lambda vs EC2. They need trade-offs, not just definitions.

## Solution

This tool asks a few constraints and compares Lambda and EC2 with pros, cons, and a clear recommendation.

## How Kiro helped

Kiro helped clarify the problem, define the key questions, and outline the decision logic faster than doing it manually.
